COVID-19 Dataset to Predict Patient Mortality 
Developed a predictive model using machine learning algorithms to forecast patient mortality based on historical health data and comorbidities. This project involved extensive data preprocessing, feature selection, and model training using Python libraries such as Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and Matplotlib. The model achieved a high accuracy rate, providing valuable insights to healthcare providers for prioritizing and managing patient care effectively during the pandemic.
